    "Methods for calculating square roots seek to identify the non negative square root of a number (commonly denoted as √S, 2√S, or S1/2 ) of a real number [1]. Real numbers are any positive or negative number including all integers (whole positive or negative numbers or 0), rational(can be expressed as a fraction) and irrational numbers (can be expressed as an infinite decimal representation e.g. 3.1415926535....).  Real numbers which include decimal points are called floating point numbers, since the decimal \"floats\" between the digits [2].  Irrational numbers with infinite decimal representation are generally estimated by computers [2]. For most numbers their square root is an irrational number [1] Moreover, even in the case of computing the square root of a perfect square integer where a square root with an exact finite represenation exists, only a series of increasingly accurate approximations are returned.

    "\n",
    "Typically analytical methods to calcuate square roots tend to be iterative and have two steps. Firstly an initial guess $s$ of the square root is provided. This number can be any number as long as it is less that the number $x$ where √X is the number sought. Secondly, each iteration produces a better guess or is closer in refinement to the √X until a required accuracy is met or when a maximum number of iteratiions (predefined) have been reached for slowly converging algorithms. The closer this initial guess is to the √S then the less iterations will performed[1],[4].  \n",
    "\n",
    "Newton's method is one such approach and will be used for this task as it the most widely used approach and the most suitable to computational [1],[4]. Newtowns method can be implemented to calculate the square root $s$ of a number $x$, where $x \\gt 0$ and $s = \\sqrt x $. Starting with an initial guess for the square root, $s_0$, the algorithm calculates a better guess using the formula\n",
    "$$ s_{n+1} = s_n - \\left ( \\frac{s_n^2 - x}{2 s_n} \\right ). $$\n",
    "$s_{n}$ is the previous estimate for the square root and $s_{n+1}$ is the revised/updated appromiation.\n",
